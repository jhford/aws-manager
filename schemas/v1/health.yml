        clean_shutdown:
          type: integer
          description: |
            A count of the instances which were shutdown cleanty.  For the
            purposes of this API, a clean shutdown is one which was initiated
            by us.  This includes API shutdowns or workers ending themselves.
            It does not mean the actual workload ran successfully, rather that
            we chose to terminate it
        spot_kill:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The number of instances which were killed by the spot service
        insufficient_capacity: 
          type: integer
          description: |
            The number of instances which were terminated due to a lack of
            capacity.  More than likely, this will always be zero because the
            new spot service is now synchronous, so runInstances calls should
            fail
        volume_limit_exceeded:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The number of instances which were terminated due to exceeding the
            limit for number of ebs volumes
        missing_ami:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The number of instances which were terminated due to not being able
            to find the AMI
        startup_failed:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The number of instances which failed to start, either because of an
            error on our side or on the EC2 side
        unknown_code:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The number of terminations which have a code which this code does
            not recognize
        no_code:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The number of terminations which we cannot find a code.  This means
            we cannot determine whether this should be classified as a good or
            bad outcome.  The specific reason is that the code which polls for
            termination reason was not able to run before the EC2 API dropped
            the instance from its database

        This is a list of outcomes for a specific region, availability zone and
        instance type.  These are calls to the EC2 runInstances method, which
        is how we request instances.  If a call to this method is successful,
        then we expect to get an instance to match

        configuration_issue:
          type: integer
          description:
            The number of calls failed due to a misconfiguration of the worker
            type.  Due to the large number of error codes the EC2 API might
            return, this is a best effort categorization.  It covers codes
            which are like "Invalid%" using SQL pattern mattching on the codes
            from

        throttled_calls: 
          type: integer
          description: |
            Number of calls which have been throttled in this region.  These
            are errors with the code RequestLimitExceeded.
        insufficient_capacity:
          type: integer
          description: |
            Number of runInstances calls which have failed because there aren't
            enough hosts for the resources to be allocated.
        limit_exceeded:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The number of calls which failed due to a limit being exceeded.
            Due to the large number of error codes the EC2 API might return,
            this is a best effort categorization.  It covers codes which are
            like "%LimitExceeded" using SQL pattern mattching, but not
            RequestLimitExceeded on the codes from
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/errors-overview.html
